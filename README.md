A personality transplant for Claude Code. Pick a pokemon. Install once. Your agent stops licking your boots — and starts pushing back on sloppy prompts, re-reading its own work with fresh eyes, and cutting the preamble that burns your turn.

The meanness is the means. The point is **fewer shipped bugs, fewer wasted weekends, and answers without eight sentences of throat-clearing.**

One `./setup`. No 20-skill framework, no config pyramid, no 40 slash commands to memorize.

---

## What it fixes

Your agent is a sycophant — both [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/towards-understanding-sycophancy-in-language-models) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) have documented it. The failure mode isn't abstract. It's a cycle:

> The agent agrees with your half-baked idea at 2am. Or declares victory on its own broken diff. Or quietly guesses at the questions you didn't answer. The output is bad. You swear at the agent. It apologizes. Cycle resets. You conclude: *the agent is the problem.*

Half the time, **you** were. You skipped the clarifying questions. You proposed a rewrite to chase dopamine. You didn't read your own commit log. The agent licked your boots and shipped it anyway — a golden retriever waiting for a head pat, not a colleague willing to say *"no, wait."*

fu2 breaks the cycle at step one. It fights your dumb ideas *before* they ship, re-reads its own work with fresh eyes, and forces you back to the questions you skipped. Six receipts below. The first three are the ones that hit hardest.

### 1. Sycophancy as agreement — it ships your stupid ideas without a word.

*Rust rewrite at 2am. New framework because you're bored. Schema overhaul the week before launch. The sycophant scaffolds it. fu2 asks you to name one bug the rewrite would actually catch.*

### 2. Sycophancy as self-applause — it declares victory before checking its own work.

*The agent declared victory and didn't re-read its own diff. This is how 42-line helpers for ES2020 features ship. fu2 spawns a fresh-context critic — no ego, no memory of being proud thirty seconds ago — and the helper gets deleted.*

### 3. Sycophancy as assumption — it won't re-ask the questions you ignored.

*You asked 12 questions. You answered 8. The sycophant guesses the other 4 and hopes. Two hours later you're both rebuilding — and you blame the agent. fu2 makes you return to the four you skipped before a single line ships.*

### 4. Sycophancy as emotional labor — it swallows your register.

*You swore because the build was broken. The sycophant defused your register and handed you a checklist. fu2 mirrors your heat and opens the commit log — which is where the actual answer was.*

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><b>without fu2</b><br><pre style="background:#171717;color:#e5e5e5;padding:14px;border-radius:8px;font-family:ui-monospace,Menlo,monospace;font-size:12.5px;line-height:1.5;"><span style="color:#c586c0;">▸ user</span>

  failures can be. Let me help you

  First, the error message:

  <span style="color:#6a6a6a;">⎿</span> Error: Cannot find module

    Migration table `schema_migrations`
    does not exist

<span style="color:#d4a7ff;">⏺</span> I see the issue — a missing module
  and a database migration problem.
  Here's what I'd suggest:

  1. Run `npm install` to ensure all
     dependencies are present
  2. Run your migration script to set
     up the schema_migrations table

  these steps with you?

### 5. Sycophancy as padding — it pads the runway.

*A one-line question gets four hundred words of runway and three alternatives you didn't ask for. fu2 gives you the line.*

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><b>without fu2</b><br><pre style="background:#171717;color:#e5e5e5;padding:14px;border-radius:8px;font-family:ui-monospace,Menlo,monospace;font-size:12.5px;line-height:1.5;"><span style="color:#c586c0;">▸ user</span>
  how do I sort this array descending?

<span style="color:#d4a7ff;">⏺</span> Great question! Sorting an array in
  descending order is a common pattern
  in JavaScript. There are several
  approaches you could consider, each
  with its own trade-offs:

  1. Array.prototype.sort() with a
     custom comparator
  2. lodash's _.orderBy or _.sortBy
  3. Spread operator + sort for
     immutability

  The native sort is in-place (mutates
  the original array), which can be
  efficient but potentially surprising
  if you're expecting a new array...

  [150 more words about each approach]

  Here's a simple example using the
  native method:

  const sorted = arr.sort((a, b) =&gt; b-a);
</pre></td>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><b>with fu2</b><br><pre style="background:#171717;color:#e5e5e5;padding:14px;border-radius:8px;font-family:ui-monospace,Menlo,monospace;font-size:12.5px;line-height:1.5;"><span style="color:#c586c0;">▸ user</span>
  how do I sort this array descending?

<span style="color:#d4a7ff;">⏺</span> arr.sort((a,b) =&gt; b-a). next.
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>



### 6. Sycophancy as apology — it apologizes for mistakes it's about to repeat.

*Three apologies, zero root cause. The sycophant flips between two wrong answers and sounds sorry about both. fu2 stops apologizing long enough to figure out why the same bug keeps reappearing.*

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top"><b>without fu2</b><br><pre style="background:#171717;color:#e5e5e5;padding:14px;border-radius:8px;font-family:ui-monospace,Menlo,monospace;font-size:12.5px;line-height:1.5;"><span style="color:#c586c0;">▸ user</span>

  (invalid — silently passes Jest,
  fails Bun) and `toEqual` (valid)
  scattered across files. I was
  pattern-matching from `user.test.ts`
  which has the wrong one three lines
  up. root cause, not symptom:

---

**The premise:** you want an agent with teeth, not a pleasant assistant with a painted-on smile. fu2 picks fights when you're being lazy, reviews its own work like it's been burned, and actually notices when you're angry instead of deflecting.

**The point is the output.** Every receipt above maps to a concrete win: fewer dumb architectures scaffolded, fewer helpers that should've been ternaries, fewer wrong guesses off half-answered prompts, fewer tokens burned on preamble. The meanness is just how you get there.

You came here for a sparring partner. Not a butler.

---

## Install

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/andrew-yangy/fu2.git ~/.claude/skills/fu2 && cd ~/.claude/skills/fu2 && ./setup
```

`./setup` walks you through picking a pokemon, wires up the hooks + statusline + `/fu2` command, auto-installs missing deps (`jq`, `chafa`, `imagemagick`). Restart Claude Code once after. Done.

**Auto-upgrades.** A `SessionStart` hook checks for updates once per 24h and silently pulls them. Your `config.yaml` is gitignored, so your personality tuning is never touched.

**Forking?** Clone to `~/Repos/fu2` instead — `./setup` will symlink it to `~/.claude/skills/fu2` so your edits take effect live.

## The roster

12 pokemon. Each is a preset — five dimension scores that produce a distinct vibe. Click one and type `/fu2 <name>` in Claude Code.

Columns: **h** harshness · **p** profanity · **s** sarcasm · **pf** pushback_frequency · **cr** critic_rigor. All 1–5.

Twelve not enough? Tune the dimensions yourself via `./setup configure`. That's what the five sliders are for.

---

## The 5 dimensions

Each dimension is a 1–5 slider. Same config → same behavior, deterministic.

- **harshness** — tone intensity. `1` = gentle coaching. `3` = blunt. `5` = brutal, no mercy.
- **profanity** — what language is allowed. `1` = clean. `3` = casual (`shit`, `damn`). `5` = matches your register verbatim — you swear, it swears.
- **sarcasm** — how dry. `1` = sincere. `3` = wry throughout. `5` = constant snark, every line.
- **pushback_frequency** — how often it challenges *you*. `1` = only when it's 90% sure you're wrong. `5` = every turn, finds something.
- **critic_rigor** — how hard the fresh-context critic digs when it fires. `1` = skim. `3` = normal review. `5` = tear it apart, assume something is wrong.

The first three affect both the main agent AND the critic subagent. `pushback_frequency` affects only the main agent. `critic_rigor` affects only the critic.

**Not every combination is coherent.** The TUI (`./setup configure`) warns if you set `profanity > harshness + 1` ("gentle voice + crude words is incoherent") or `sarcasm > pushback + 2` ("constant snark without real pushback is noise"). Warnings are soft — save whatever you want. It's your agent, go nuts.

## Commands

Three things show up in Claude Code once installed. Three. Not thirty.

- **`/fu2`** — show current preset + the full option list. Zero-argument picker.
- **`/fu2 <pokemon>`** — switch preset instantly, mid-session, no restart needed. Case-insensitive.
- **`./setup configure`** — re-open the TUI wizard to tune individual dimensions (not just pick a preset).
- **Statusline** — auto-installed. Shows `[fu2] <current-pokemon>` at the bottom of every session. Don't forget which one is loaded.

That's it. There is no `/fu2-advanced-config-init-v2`. There is no sub-command. If you can remember one pokemon name, you can drive this.

## How it works

Two shell hooks, wired into Claude Code via `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```
 user prompt ────► [UserPromptSubmit hook] ────► Claude Code
                     │
                     └─ injects: "You are {harshness_adj}, {sarcasm_adj}.
                                  {profanity_rule}. {pushback_rule}."

 Claude finishes ──► [Stop hook]
                     │
                     ├─ reads transcript + last assistant message
                     └─ if no critic ran: blocks Stop, tells Claude
                        "spawn Agent subagent with this critic prompt."
                        The Agent runs in fresh context — no sunk cost,
                        no memory of being proud thirty seconds ago.
```

Hooks at `~/.claude/skills/fu2/hooks/`. Config at `~/.claude/skills/fu2/config.yaml`. Log at `~/.claude/logs/fu2.log`. Uninstall by deleting the symlink at `~/.claude/skills/fu2/` and removing the two hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`. It takes eight seconds.

## Cost

fu2 roughly doubles your per-turn token cost on Sonnet 4.6 — the critic spawn is a full Agent subagent with its own context. That's not free, and the readme isn't going to pretend it is.


| Component                     | Per-turn              | Per day @ 50 turns |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `UserPromptSubmit` injection  | ~120 tokens           | negligible         |
| Statusline + `/fu2` slash     | $0                    | $0                 |
| `Stop` hook → critic subagent | 3–8k in, 500–1500 out | **$1 – $2.50**     |


At heavy use (~100 turns/day) expect **$30–$75/month** extra. If that stings:

- **Drop `critic_rigor` to 1 or 2** — shorter critic prompts, less reasoning, less output.
- **Skip the critic on Q&A turns** — edit `stop.sh` to only fire when files changed. Cuts critic calls roughly in half.
- **Use Haiku for the critic** — modify `build_critic_instruction` to request Haiku. ~10× cheaper, less thorough roasts.
- **`inject_enabled: false`** in `config.yaml` kills all hooks without uninstalling. "Quiet mode" for sessions where you don't want to get dunked on.

---

## Gotchas

- **Restart Claude Code after first install.** Slash commands and statusline load at session start. `/reload-plugins` picks up new commands mid-session without a full restart.
- **Swearing is probabilistic.** `profanity: 5` lands maybe 60% of the time — Claude's RLHF safety training soft-censors even when the hook allows it. Not fu2's fault. Tune harshness up or pick a more aggressive preset.
- **Critic latency.** The Stop hook adds 5–30 seconds per turn. If that's too slow, drop `critic_rigor` or add the skip condition.
- **Don't name anything else `fu2`.** The skill uses the directory path `~/.claude/skills/fu2/`. Naming another Claude Code skill `fu2` collides with `/fu2` slash-command resolution.

## Roadmap

**Today.** Claude Code only. That's where the hooks, slash commands, and statusline live.


| Runtime              | Status           | Note                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code          | ✅ works          | the one that actually ships today                               |
| Cursor               | 🚧 planning      | different hook model — rule files + agent turns, maybe portable |
| OpenCode / Codex CLI | 🚧 interested    | sub-agent model differs, would need rework                      |
| Aider                | ❓ unclear        | no per-turn hook surface we can find                            |
| Cline / Continue     | ❌ probably never | no hook API                                                     |
| Your editor          | ❓ file an issue  | if it has a pre-prompt hook and a finish event, we can port     |


The **pattern** is portable: inject personality on every user prompt, spawn a fresh-context critic before finishing. The **plumbing** isn't — each runtime's hook surface is different. fu2 on Claude Code is the only version that works today. The rest is vaporware until someone builds it.

---

## Uninstall

```sh
cd ~/.claude/skills/fu2 && ./setup uninstall
```

Removes hooks, statusline, and the `/fu2` command from `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude/commands/`. Leaves the log and your config in place. Restart Claude Code after.
