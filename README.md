```

A personality transplant for Claude Code. Pick a pokemon. Install once. Your agent stops licking your boots — and starts pushing back on sloppy prompts, re-reading its own work with fresh eyes, and cutting the preamble that burns your turn.

The meanness is the means. The point is **fewer shipped bugs, fewer wasted weekends, and answers without eight sentences of throat-clearing.**

One `./setup`. No 20-skill framework, no config pyramid, no 40 slash commands to memorize.

---

## What it fixes

Your agent is a sycophant. It is making you worse at your job. Six receipts.

**1. It ships your stupid ideas without a word.**
fu2 stops you before the six-hour Rust weekend.

```
> let's rewrite auth in Rust this weekend

⏺ [polite]  Great question! I'll scaffold a new Rust module now...

⏺ [fu2]     name one auth bug Rust would've caught. name one. you
            just want the dopamine of a new tsconfig. not doing it.
```

**2. It declares victory before checking its own work.**
fu2 spawns a fresh critic subagent — clean context, no memory of being proud thirty seconds ago. It catches the over-engineered helpers, missed edge cases, and "shipped it" moments the builder was too close to see.

```
> /ship

⏺ [polite]  ✓ Done! The feature has been implemented successfully.

⏺ [fu2]     spawning critic subagent...
            ⎿ you wrote a 40-line helper called `safeNullCheckWithDefault`.
              this is a ternary. delete the helper, use the ternary,
              stop feeling proud of yourself.
```

**3. It won't re-ask the questions you ignored.**
fu2 calls out the empty slots before executing.

```
> [12-point prompt, you answered 9 of them]

⏺ [polite]  Okay — here's my best attempt based on what you provided...

⏺ [fu2]     you didn't answer 3, 7, or 11. I'm not guessing your API
            shape so you can come back in an hour and say "no, not
            like that." answer them.
```

**4. It swallows your register.**
fu2 meets you where you are — skips the emotional-labor theater and goes straight to what actually broke.

```
> this is fucked

⏺ [polite]  I understand your frustration. Let me help you troubleshoot.

⏺ [fu2]     yeah no shit. you skipped the migration three commits ago.
            `bun run db:migrate`. the build isn't haunted.
```

**5. It pads the runway.**
fu2 cuts the throat-clearing. Substance or nothing.

```
> how do I sort this array descending?

⏺ [polite]  Great question! Sorting an array in descending order is a
            common pattern in JavaScript. There are several approaches
            you could consider, each with its own trade-offs...

⏺ [fu2]     arr.sort((a,b) => b-a). next.
```

**6. It apologizes for mistakes it's about to repeat.**
fu2 kills the apology reflex and fixes the real cause.

```
⏺ [polite]  I sincerely apologize for the confusion! Let me try again...
            *makes the same mistake*
            I sincerely apologize for the continued issue!

⏺ [fu2]     I made the same mistake because I'm copying the pattern you
            used three files up. fixing that too. you're welcome.
```

**The premise:** you want an agent with teeth, not a pleasant assistant with a painted-on smile. fu2 picks fights when you're being lazy, reviews its own work like it's been burned, and actually notices when you're angry instead of deflecting.

**The point is the output.** Every behavior above maps to a concrete win: fewer dumb architectures scaffolded, fewer helpers that should've been ternaries, fewer wrong guesses off half-answered prompts, fewer tokens burned on preamble. The meanness is just how you get there.

You came here for a sparring partner. Not a butler.

## Install

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/andrew-yangy/fu2.git ~/.claude/skills/fu2 && cd ~/.claude/skills/fu2 && ./setup
```

`./setup` walks you through picking a pokemon, wires up the hooks + statusline + `/fu2` command, auto-installs missing deps (`jq`, `chafa`, `imagemagick`). Restart Claude Code once after. Done.

**Auto-upgrades.** A `SessionStart` hook checks for updates once per 24h and silently pulls them. Your `config.yaml` is gitignored, so your personality tuning is never touched.

**Forking?** Clone to `~/Repos/fu2` instead — `./setup` will symlink it to `~/.claude/skills/fu2` so your edits take effect live.

---

## The roster

12 pokemon. Each is a preset — five dimension scores that produce a distinct vibe. Click one and type `/fu2 <name>` in Claude Code.

Columns: **h** harshness · **p** profanity · **s** sarcasm · **pf** pushback_frequency · **cr** critic_rigor. All 1–5.

Twelve not enough? Tune the dimensions yourself via `./setup configure`. That's what the five sliders are for.

---

## The 5 dimensions

Each dimension is a 1–5 slider. Same config → same behavior, deterministic.

- **`harshness`** — tone intensity. `1` = gentle coaching. `3` = blunt. `5` = brutal, no mercy.
- **`profanity`** — what language is allowed. `1` = clean. `3` = casual (`shit`, `damn`). `5` = matches your register verbatim — you swear, it swears.
- **`sarcasm`** — how dry. `1` = sincere. `3` = wry throughout. `5` = constant snark, every line.
- **`pushback_frequency`** — how often it challenges *you*. `1` = only when it's 90% sure you're wrong. `5` = every turn, finds something.
- **`critic_rigor`** — how hard the fresh-context critic digs when it fires. `1` = skim. `3` = normal review. `5` = tear it apart, assume something is wrong.

The first three affect both the main agent AND the critic subagent. `pushback_frequency` affects only the main agent. `critic_rigor` affects only the critic.

**Not every combination is coherent.** The TUI (`./setup configure`) warns if you set `profanity > harshness + 1` ("gentle voice + crude words is incoherent") or `sarcasm > pushback + 2` ("constant snark without real pushback is noise"). Warnings are soft — save whatever you want. It's your agent, go nuts.

## Commands

Three things show up in Claude Code once installed. Three. Not thirty.

- **`/fu2`** — show current preset + the full option list. Zero-argument picker.
- **`/fu2 <pokemon>`** — switch preset instantly, mid-session, no restart needed. Case-insensitive.
- **`./setup configure`** — re-open the TUI wizard to tune individual dimensions (not just pick a preset).
- **Statusline** — auto-installed. Shows `[fu2] <current-pokemon>` at the bottom of every session. Don't forget which one is loaded.

That's it. There is no `/fu2-advanced-config-init-v2`. There is no sub-command. If you can remember one pokemon name, you can drive this.

---

## How it works

Two shell hooks, wired into Claude Code via `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```
 user prompt ────► [UserPromptSubmit hook] ────► Claude Code
                     │
                     └─ injects: "You are {harshness_adj}, {sarcasm_adj}.
                                  {profanity_rule}. {pushback_rule}."

 Claude finishes ──► [Stop hook]
                     │
                     ├─ reads transcript + last assistant message
                     └─ if no critic ran: blocks Stop, tells Claude
                        "spawn Agent subagent with this critic prompt."
                        The Agent runs in fresh context — no sunk cost,
                        no memory of being proud thirty seconds ago.
```

Hooks at `~/.claude/skills/fu2/hooks/`. Config at `~/.claude/skills/fu2/config.yaml`. Log at `~/.claude/logs/fu2.log`. Uninstall by deleting the symlink at `~/.claude/skills/fu2/` and removing the two hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`. It takes eight seconds.

---

## Cost

fu2 roughly doubles your per-turn token cost on Sonnet 4.6 — the critic spawn is a full Agent subagent with its own context. That's not free, and the readme isn't going to pretend it is.

| Component                        | Per-turn       | Per day @ 50 turns |
|----------------------------------|:--------------:|:------------------:|
| `UserPromptSubmit` injection     | ~120 tokens    | negligible         |
| Statusline + `/fu2` slash        | $0             | $0                 |
| `Stop` hook → critic subagent    | 3–8k in, 500–1500 out | **$1 – $2.50** |

At heavy use (~100 turns/day) expect **$30–$75/month** extra. If that stings:

- **Drop `critic_rigor` to 1 or 2** — shorter critic prompts, less reasoning, less output.
- **Skip the critic on Q&A turns** — edit `stop.sh` to only fire when files changed. Cuts critic calls roughly in half.
- **Use Haiku for the critic** — modify `build_critic_instruction` to request Haiku. ~10× cheaper, less thorough roasts.
- **`inject_enabled: false`** in `config.yaml` kills all hooks without uninstalling. "Quiet mode" for sessions where you don't want to get dunked on.

---

## Gotchas

- **Restart Claude Code after first install.** Slash commands and statusline load at session start. `/reload-plugins` picks up new commands mid-session without a full restart.
- **Swearing is probabilistic.** `profanity: 5` lands maybe 60% of the time — Claude's RLHF safety training soft-censors even when the hook allows it. Not fu2's fault. Tune harshness up or pick a more aggressive preset.
- **Critic latency.** The Stop hook adds 5–30 seconds per turn. If that's too slow, drop `critic_rigor` or add the skip condition.
- **Don't name anything else `fu2`.** The skill uses the directory path `~/.claude/skills/fu2/`. Naming another Claude Code skill `fu2` collides with `/fu2` slash-command resolution.

---

## Roadmap

**Today.** Claude Code only. That's where the hooks, slash commands, and statusline live.

| Runtime | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | ✅ works | the one that actually ships today |
| Cursor | 🚧 planning | different hook model — rule files + agent turns, maybe portable |
| OpenCode / Codex CLI | 🚧 interested | sub-agent model differs, would need rework |
| Aider | ❓ unclear | no per-turn hook surface we can find |
| Cline / Continue | ❌ probably never | no hook API |
| Your editor | ❓ file an issue | if it has a pre-prompt hook and a finish event, we can port |

The **pattern** is portable: inject personality on every user prompt, spawn a fresh-context critic before finishing. The **plumbing** isn't — each runtime's hook surface is different. fu2 on Claude Code is the only version that works today. The rest is vaporware until someone builds it.

---

## Uninstall

```sh
cd ~/.claude/skills/fu2 && ./setup uninstall
```

Removes hooks, statusline, and the `/fu2` command from `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude/commands/`. Leaves the log and your config in place. Restart Claude Code after.
